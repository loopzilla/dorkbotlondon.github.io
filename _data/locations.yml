        <b>==== How to get to Limehouse Town Hall: ====</b>

        <b>== By Tube:</b>
        Limehouse DLR from Bank or Tower Gateway

        <b>== By Bus:</b>
        15 from Trafalgar Sq / 115 from Aldgate /
        D6 from Hackney / D3 from Bethnal Green

        NB Google's location for this postcode is a bit off, it's actually where
        Commercial Road crosses the Limehouse Cut canal, or in other words...
        Get onto Commercial Road and travel East from Aldgate or Whitechapel.
        Stay on Commercial Road, passing Limehouse DLR on your right (and
        going under a railway bridge) and you'll see a modern red brick church
        also on the right, then a boarded up library. Just over the canal
        you'll see the Town Hall, with the Limehouse Hawksmoor church behind
        it, on the opposite side of the road from the big metal anchor. At
        this point you should get off the bus/bicycle and come ring on the
        "Boxing Club" bell (The top of the 4 main buttons).

         Unfortunately the building is not currently wheelchair accessible - there are steps from the
        street and up to the main hall.
